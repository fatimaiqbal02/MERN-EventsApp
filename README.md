# MERN Events App
Welcome to the MERN Events App repository! This is a comprehensive Event Management System built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The app allows
users to effortlessly explore, review, and book events at designated venues, on specific dates and time slots.
Below is a detailed guide to understanding and using the app effectively.

## Introduction
MERN Events App is a full-stack web application designed to simplify event booking and management. The app consists of two modules: Users and Admin. Users can browse, review, and book events, while Admins have full control over user management, event creation, timeslots management, review management, bookings management and more. 
The app implements various modern web development concepts and technologies, including all important topics of React, MongoDB database, Node.js server, and Express.js framework.

## Features
- **Event Exploration:** Users can browse through a list of events, view event details, venue information, and pricing per person. They can also see the minimum and maximum guest sizes allowed for each event.

- **Dynamic Pricing:** As users specify the number of guests they plan to bring, the pricing adjusts dynamically, ensuring transparency and flexibility in event selection.

- **Booking System:** Users can book events by selecting a specific timeslot and day. The system automatically checks availability, preventing double bookings and ensuring event integrity.

- **User Authentication:** Users are required to log in to access review and booking features. Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user sessions.

- **User Reviews:** Authenticated users can leave reviews for events they've attended, sharing their experiences and opinions.

- **Admin Privileges:** Admins have access to a dedicated admin panel where they can manage users, events, timeslots, reviews, and bookings. They can perform CRUD operations seamlessly.

- **Modern UI with React:** The app boasts a user-friendly and responsive interface created with React, leveraging hooks, state management, and reusable components.
